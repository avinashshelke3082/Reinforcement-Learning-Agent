 Reinforcement learning is an area of Machine Learning. It is about taking suitable action to  maximize reward in a particular situation.

What is Reinforcement Learning?

● Reinforcement learning is an area of Machine Learning. It is about taking suitable action to 
maximize reward in a particular situation.

● It is employed by various software and machines to find the best possible behavior or path it 
should take in a specific situation.

● Reinforcement learning differs from supervised learning in that the training data has the
answer key with it so the model is trained with the correct answer.

● Whereas in reinforcement learning, there is no answer but the reinforcement agent decides 
what to do to perform the given task.

● Without a training dataset, it is bound to learn from its experience.


Key points in Reinforcement learning?

● Input:
○ The input should be an initial state from which the model will start.

● Output:
○ There are many possible outputs as there are a variety of solutions to a particular problem.

● Training:
○ The training is based upon the input, The model will return a state and the user will decide 
to reward or punish the model based on its output.

● The model keeps learning.
○ The best solution is decided based on the maximum reward
